The data was [extracted](https://github.com/bankoleifeolukayode/Project-1/blob/main/Data%20Extraction.pbix) from the company's SQL server. <br><br>
**DATA ASSESSMENT** <br>
The column distribution, column profile and column quality was elucidated from the view ribbon of the power query editor. This was done to ascertain and check for the possibility of errors, null values, empty spaces and data uniqueness and distintiveness.   <br><br>
**DATA TRANSFORMATION**<br>
Transformation was done on the already assessed data. The data had alot of issues and required thorough cleaning, formatting, styling and re-organisation. This was done with a very high level of professionalism in order to maintain the integrity and originality of the data. The [Transformed Data](https://github.com/bankoleifeolukayode/Project-1/blob/main/Data%20Transformation.pbix) was then saved and made ready for the Data Modelling. <br><br>
**DATA MODELLING**<br>
Power BI's data modeling capabilities were used to create relationships between different datasets. Data hieracchy and date table creation using DAX was done, enabling a holistic view of the organization's performance. <br><br>
**VISUALIZATION** <br>
Various Power BI [visualizations](https://github.com/bankoleifeolukayode/Project-1/blob/main/Data%20Visualization.pbix), such as Column charts, pie charts, and maps, were employed to create compelling visual representations of the data. These visuals allowed for easy interpretation of performance trends. The core focus of the project was on analyzing performance data over time. This involved creating time-based visualizations to track changes, seasonality, and growth in various KPIs. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as profit margins was analyzed over time to assess the company's overall performance in the regions where sales took place. <br><br>
